# itgc-2022-map

A Python-flask site to display science of [ITGC](https://thwaitesglacier.org/) cruise NBP 2202 in a leaflet map.

This repo contains the source code for the interactive map at [nbp2202map.com/](https://nbp2202map.com/)

The map is built on a one page Python flask app inspired by the [UEA glider group piloting site](https://github.com/ueaglider/ueaglider-web)
